# 🛠️ Task 5 – Network Capture & Protocol Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark, analyze it, and identify at least three types of network protocols.

## 📂 Files Included

- `capture_task5.pcap`: Network traffic capture file
- `REPORT.md`: Detailed analysis of identified protocols
- `screenshots/`: Visual proofs of analysis and capture

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Wireshark v4.x
- ping, curl (for traffic generation)
- Chrome browser
- AI tools (ChatGpt,Claude,Gemini,Perpexlity) ( For research and analysis )

## 🔍 Protocols Identified

- DNS – name resolution queries
- HTTP – plain web traffic
- TCP – transport layer handshake and sessions

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

- Hands-on experience in capturing real network traffic
- Improved understanding of network protocols and packet structure
- Ability to use filters and analyze packet-level details
